## Processing journal entries

I write journal entries as bullet-point notes ('points') in Google Keep, with the date as a title in `dd/mm/yy` format.

This repository contains code to analyse my journal entries, collated locally into `takeout\Keep` using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).
