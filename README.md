## Processing journal entries

I write daily journal entries as bullet-point notes ('points') in Google Keep, with the date as a title in `dd/mm/yy` format.

This repository contains code to analyse my journal entries, collated locally into `takeout-20211110T024606Z-001/Keep/` using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).
