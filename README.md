## Processing journal entries

I write daily journal entries as bullet point notes ('points') in Google Keep, with the date as a title in `dd/mm/yy` format.

This repository contains code to analyse journal entries downloaded with [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).

> As of 2024-11-09 I have ported my journal to markdown files in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault and plan to rewrite this repository accordingly.
